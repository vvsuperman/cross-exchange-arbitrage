# Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Bot

This project is a cryptocurrency futures cross-exchange arbitrage framework, intended for sharing and educational purposes only. It should not be used directly in production environments. Please use caution when trading in real markets.

## Project Overview

This project implements a cross-exchange arbitrage trading bot that currently performs spread arbitrage primarily between **edgeX** and **Lighter** exchanges. The bot executes arbitrage trades by placing post-only limit orders (maker orders) on edgeX and executing market orders on Lighter to complete the hedge.

## Features

- 🔄 **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Automatically detects and exploits price spreads between two exchanges
- 📊 **Real-time Order Book Management**: Monitors order book changes in real-time via WebSocket
- 📈 **Position Tracking**: Tracks and manages trading positions in real-time
- 🛡️ **Risk Control**: Supports maximum position limits and timeout controls
- 📝 **Data Logging**: Records trading data and statistics
- ⚡ **Async Execution**: High-performance asynchronous architecture based on asyncio

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- edgeX and Lighter exchange accounts
- API keys and access permissions

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cross-exchange-arbitrage
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` and fill in your API credentials:

```bash
cp env_example.txt .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and fill in your API information:

```env
# edgeX Account Credentials (Required)
EDGEX_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
EDGEX_STARK_PRIVATE_KEY=your_stark_private_key_here

# EdgeX API Endpoints
EDGEX_BASE_URL=https://pro.edgex.exchange
EDGEX_WS_URL=wss://quote.edgex.exchange

# Lighter Configuration (Required)
API_KEY_PRIVATE_KEY=your_api_key_private_key_here
LIGHTER_ACCOUNT_INDEX=your_account_index
LIGHTER_API_KEY_INDEX=your_api_key_index
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python arbitrage.py --ticker BTC --size 0.002 --max-position 0.1 --long-threshold 10 --short-threshold 10
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--exchange`: Exchange name (default: edgex)
- `--ticker`: Trading pair symbol (default: BTC)
- `--size`: Order size per trade (required)
- `--max-position`: Maximum position limit (required)
- `--long-threshold`: Long arbitrage trigger threshold (how much higher Lighter bid price must be than edgeX ask price to trigger long edgeX arbitrage, default: 10)
- `--short-threshold`: Short arbitrage trigger threshold (how much higher edgeX bid price must be than Lighter ask price to trigger short edgeX arbitrage, default: 10)
- `--fill-timeout`: Limit order fill timeout (seconds, default: 5)

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Trade ETH, 0.01 ETH per order, set 5 second timeout
python arbitrage.py --ticker ETH --size 0.01 --long-threshold 10 --short-threshold 10 --max-position 0.1 --fill-timeout 5

# Trade BTC, limit maximum position to 0.1 BTC
python arbitrage.py --ticker BTC --size 0.002 --long-threshold 1 --short-threshold 20 --max-position 0.1
```

## How It Works

1. **Order Book Monitoring**: Receives real-time order book updates from both exchanges via WebSocket
2. **Spread Detection**: Calculates price spreads between the two exchanges
3. **Arbitrage Opportunity Identification**: Identifies arbitrage opportunities when spreads exceed thresholds
4. **Order Execution**:
   - Places post-only limit orders (maker orders, earning fees) on edgeX
   - Executes market orders on Lighter to complete the hedge
5. **Position Management**: Tracks positions in real-time to ensure they don't exceed maximum position limits
6. **Risk Control**: Monitors order fill status and cancels orders if they don't fill within the timeout period

## Development Principles

- Prefer the smallest implementation that matches the real logic of the current page or flow.
- Do not introduce preventive generalization; avoid building compatibility layers, shared frameworks, or extension points for hypothetical future cases.
- Every compatibility branch must be justified by a reproduced problem and should be traceable to a specific failure case in the code.
- This rule applies to all code, not just UI automation; business logic, data structures, API wrappers, configuration design, and tooling should not be generalized casually.

Start with the shortest implementation that matches the current problem and business path. Only add extra compatibility branches, abstractions, or extension points after the simple implementation has been clearly proven insufficient.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Risk Warning**:

- Arbitrage trading carries market risks. Please ensure you fully understand the trading mechanisms
- It is recommended to test in a test environment or with small amounts first
- Be aware of network latency and exchange API limits
- Regularly check positions and account balance

## Dependencies

Main dependencies include:

- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `asyncio`: Asynchronous programming support
- `requests`: HTTP requests
- `tenacity`: Retry mechanism
- `edgex-python-sdk`: Official edgeX Python SDK (forked version, supports post-only limit orders)
- `lighter-python`: Lighter exchange SDK
